    <h2><a id="home">About EZ Power</a></h2>
    <p>EZ Power is all about batteries, power banks, and portable power bases. 
    Many people already carry around small power banks to charge their electronics on-the-go. 
    If you are one of these people, you know how expensive they are and really how nice they are to have.
    EZ Power is all about having those type of power banks, but on a larger scale.  
    From power banks in ammo crates to ones that are as big as generators, we try and make it so you can have power anywhere you go, and whenever you need. 
    These power banks are also some of the safest to have, as they don't run off of gasoline like other generators.  This makes it so you can have them anywhere. 
    Here you can buy from us, learn how to make them yourself, and review the basic need for powerbanks.</p>

  <h2><a id="need">The Need</a></h2>
  <p>As many have already, powerbanks make it so you have power with you anywhere you go.  
  These powerbanks usually can charge a cellphone.  How much the cellphone actually charges is dependent on how big the battery is. 
  Our powerbanks are bigger from the average ones, as they run off of bigger batteries. Our smallest tops out at 12 volts. 
  This will charge your cellphone, and other devices, multiple times each.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Since we all have electronics, we want to be able to charge them whenever and wherever necessary. 
  In activities like camping or ATV riding, for example, we can see how being able to charge an electronic whenever is hard. 
  Our products are portable and can travel with you wherever you go, making it possible for you to have power whenever and wherever.
  Being in containers like Army Ammo boxes, they are well protected and strong enough to take a beating and still keep going.
  The containers also have some space to place smaller electronics to be protected.
  In our biggest generators, it can store the electronics you are trying to power.
  You can also see how convienent these can be in the event of a power outage, or emergency in which you need power.
  As we have seen in previous emergencies, like Hurricane Katrina, people have needed power for various necessities, the simplest to charge a phone and keep in contact with loved ones. 
  The generators can even be used to help large groups that are sheltered.  So as you can see, these are very useful for everyday activities, recreation, and emergencies.
  All that said, it is always a good idea to have some backup power.</p>
