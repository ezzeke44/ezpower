    <h2><a id="home">About EZ Power</a></h2>
    <p>EZ Power is all about batteries, power banks, and portable power bases. 
    Many people already carry around small power banks to charge their electronics on-the-go. 
    If you are one of these people, you know how expensive they are and really how nice they are to have.
    EZ Power is all about having those type of power banks, but on a larger scale.  
    From power banks in ammo crates to ones that are as big as generators, we try and make it so you can have power anywhere you go, and whenever you need. 
    These power banks are also some of the safest to have, as they don't run off of gasoline like other generators.  This makes it so you can have them anywhere. 
    Here you can buy from us, learn how to make them yourself, and review the basic need for powerbanks.</p>
